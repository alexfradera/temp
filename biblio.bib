  abstract = {Abstract: To assess the prevalence and factors associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients suffering from psoriatic arthritis (PsA).A cross-sectional evaluation was conducted in consecutive PsA patients. Sociodemographic data and the clinimetric variables related to PsA and psoriasis were collected for each patient. MCI was assessed through the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The cognitive performance of PsA patients was compared to healthy subjects using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The correlations among variables were studied by the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out to establish the predictors of MCI.The study involved 96 PsA patients and 48 healthy subjects. MCI (defined as a MoCA score < 26/30) was detected in 47 (48.9%) PsA patients. Compared to healthy subjects, the MoCA score resulted significantly lower in PsA patients (P = .015). The main differences involved the denomination and language domains. MoCA was negatively correlated with age (r = -0.354; P < .0001), HAQ-DI (r = -0.227; P = .026), and fatigue (r = -0.222; P = .029), and positively correlated with psoriasis duration (r = 0.316; P = .001) and DLQI (r = 0.226; P = .008).The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed the duration of psoriasis (P = .0005), age (P = .0038), PASI (P = .0050), and HAQ-DI (P = .0193) as predictors of the MoCA score.MCI is present in a significant proportion of PsA patients, and is mainly determined by age, cutaneous variables, and disability.

  abstract = {Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been associated with premature immunosenescence and an increased prevalence of age-related morbidities including poor cognitive function. Objective(s): We explored the relationships among lymphocyte subsets and memory in RA. Method(s): Thirty patients with RA and 19 age-matched healthy controls took part in this study. Cognitive function stress and depression scores were evaluated by structured clinical questionnaires. Lymphocytes were isolated and immunophenotyped by flow cytometry to investigate the following subsets: B cells, activated and naive/memory T cells, regulatory FoxP3+ T (Treg) cells, Th17+ cells, NK cells and senescence-associated CD28- T cells. Result(s): RA patients were more depressed than controls, but stress levels were similar in the 2 groups. Patients had impaired memory performance compared to controls, demonstrated by lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores and logical and working memories (all p < 0.0001). These group effects remained significant after correcting for depression and age. Patients had expansion of regulatory T cells, naive CD4+ T cells and CD8+CD28- cells but reduced percentages of B cells and memory CD8+CD45RO+ T cells compared to controls. CD8+CD28- and CD8+CD45RO+ T cells were found to be negatively associated with memory. Conclusion(s): RA patients had reduced memory performance compared to healthy controls. Expansion of activated and senescence-associated T cells was correlated with poor memory performance.Copyright © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

  abstract = {The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of pain, sedation, pain medications and socio-demographics on cognitive functioning in chronic non-malignant pain patients. Chronic non-malignant pain patients (N = 91) treated in a multidisciplinary pain centre were compared with age and sex matched healthy volunteers (N = 64). Furthermore four subgroups of patients were examined: Group 1 (N = 21) received no pain medications, group 2 (N = 19) were in long-term oral opioid treatment, group 3 (N = 18) were treated with antidepressants and/or anticonvulsants and group 4 (N = 33) were treated with a combination of long-term oral opioids and antidepressants and/or anticonvulsants. Assessments comprised pain (PVAS) and sedation (SVAS), Continuous Reaction Time (CRT) testing for sustained attention, Finger Tapping Test (FTT) testing for psychomotor speed, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT) testing for information processing and working memory and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). CRT and FTT were impaired in the total patient sample. Treatment with opioids was associated with poorer performance of PASAT. High scores of PVAS and SVAS were associated with poor performance of PASAT and CRT, respectively. MMSE seems to be too insensitive for detecting the milder forms of cognitive impairment found in chronic non-malignant patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},
